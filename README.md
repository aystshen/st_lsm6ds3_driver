## Usage
1. Copy lsm6ds3 to kernel/drivers/input/sensors/ directory.
2. Modify the kernel/drivers/input/sensors/Kconfig as follows
```
source "drivers/video/lsm6ds3/Kconfig"
```
3. Modify the kernel/drivers/input/sensors/Makefile as follows
```
obj-$(CONFIG_INPUT_LSM6DS3) += lsm6ds3/
```
4. Modify the dts as follows
```
&i2c2 {
	status = "okay";
	
	lsm6ds3@6b {
		compatible = "st,lsm6ds3";
		reg = <0x6b>;
		st,irq_gpio = <&gpio1 GPIO_A3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

		st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
	};
};
```
